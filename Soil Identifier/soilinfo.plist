				<string>These are acid Brunisolic soils that lack a well-developed mineral-organic surface horizon. They occur widely, usually on parent materials of low base status and typically under forest vegetation.

Dystric Brunisols have a Bm, Bfj, thin Bf, or Btj horizon at least 5 cm thick, and a pH (0.01 M CaCl2) of less than 5.5 throughout the upper 25 cm of the B horizon, or throughout the B horizon and the underlying material to a total depth of at least 25 cm or to a lithic contact above this depth. Dystric Brunisols may have L, F, and H horizons; an Ae or Aej horizon, and an Ah horizon less than 10 cm thick, but they do not have either a Bt or a podzolic B horizon. If cultivated, these soils are classified as Sombric Brunisols when the Ap horizon is at least 10 cm thick and has a moist color value less than 4 and part of the B horizon remains below the Ap. If the Ap horizon does not meet the above specifications but part of the B horizon remains below the Ap, then the soils are Dystric Brunisols. If the Ap includes all of the former B horizon, the soils are classified as Humic Regosol or Regosol, depending on the Ap horizon.</string>

These soils have the general properties specified for the Brunisolic order and the Melanic Brunisol great group. Characteristically, they have a forest mull Ah horizon with fine to medium granular structure and a brownish-colored Bm horizon with a chroma of 3 or more. The color of the B horizon normally fades with depth. Commonly the C horizon is calcareous.

Orthic Melanic Brunisols are identified by the following properties:

They have either an Ah horizon 10 cm thick or more or an Ap horizon at least 10 cm thick with a moist color value less than 4. The A horizon does not meet the requirements of a chernozemic A.
They have a pH (0.01 M CaCl2) of 5.5 or more as specified for the great group.
They have a Bm horizon at least 5 cm thick.
They lack an eluvial horizon, Ae or Aej, at least 2 cm thick.
They lack mottles that indicate gleying as specified for Gleyed Melanic Brunisols.
Orthic Melanic Brunisols and all other subgroups of Brunisolic soils may have a lithic contact within 50 cm of the surface or have turbic or andic features. These features are separated taxonomically at the family (lithic, some andic) or series (turbic) levels, or as phases of any taxonomic level above the family.

			<key>Description</key>
			<array>
				<string>These are Cryosolic soils that have developed primarily in mineral material and have marked evidence of cryoturbation (Harris et al. 1988). They generally occur on patterned ground, which includes such cryogenic forms as sorted and nonsorted circles, nets, polygons, stripes, and steps in stony or coarse-textured material and nonsorted units such as earth hummocks in medium- and fine-textured materials. The pedon includes all elements of the microtopography in cycles less than 7 m in width. Processes include sorting of different-sized particles and mixing of both mineral and organic material from different horizons. Organic (Oy) or organic-rich, mineral horizons (Ahy) are characteristically present in the region of the permafrost table (upper surface of permafrost layer), and there is generally a buildup of ice in the upper part of the permafrost layer.

Turbic Cryosols are mineral soils that have permafrost within 2 m of the surface and show marked evidence of cryoturbation laterally within the active layer, as indicated by disrupted or mixed or broken horizons, or displaced material or a combination of both.</string>

				<string>Soils of this great group have the general properties specified for the Gleysolic order and a horizon of clay accumulation (Btg). They are similar to Luvisolic soils except that they have dull colors or prominent mottling, or both, which indicates strong gleying. They may have organic surface horizons and an Ah horizon. Luvic Gleysols occur commonly on poorly drained sites in association with Luvisolic soils and in depressions in areas of Black and Dark Gray Chernozemic soils.

Luvic Gleysols usually have an eluvial horizon (Ahe, Aeg) and a Btg horizon. A Btg horizon is defined based on an increase in silicate clay over that present in the A horizon. The presence of clay skins indicates illuvial clay. Colors and mottling as specified for the Gleysolic order indicate permanent or periodic reduction. Luvic Gleysols may have an organic surface horizon and an Ah horizon. In some cases the A horizon is very dark (value of 2) when moist, but its eluvial features are usually evident on drying. Such horizons generally have darker and lighter gray streaks and splotches, which are similar to the Ahe horizons of Dark Gray Chernozemic soils. Even if the eluvial horizon is dark, the Btg horizon is diagnostic of a Luvic Gleysol.

			<array><string>Soils of this great group have a forest mull Ah horizon and eluvial and Bt horizons as indicated for the order. They occur typically under deciduous or mixed forest vegetation on calcareous materials in areas of mild, humid climate. They occur mainly in the St. Lawrence Lowland.

Under undisturbed conditions the soils may have thin L, F, and H horizons, but, because of high biological activity and the abundance of earthworms, the leaf litter is usually quickly incorporated into the soil and humified. A transitional AB or BA horizon having gray coatings on structural aggregates is generally present, particularly in medium and fine-textured soils. Although the Bt horizon is generally immediately underlain by calcareous materials, a transitional BC horizon may be present.

Under cultivated conditions the Ah and commonly part of the Ae horizon are mixed to form an Ap horizon. However the Bt and part of the Ae horizon usually remain intact under the Ap horizon unless either cultivation greatly exceeds 15 cm in depth or surface erosion has caused the Ap horizon to be developed in the Ae or Bt horizons or both.

Gray Brown Luvisols have either a forest-mull Ah horizon more than 5 cm thick or a dark-colored Ap horizon, an eluvial horizon, and a Bt horizon. The mean annual soil temperature is 8°C or higher and the soil moisture regime is humid or wetter.

			<array><string>Soils of this great group have eluvial and Bt horizons as specified for the Luvisolic order. They usually have L, F, and H horizons and may have a degraded Ah or Abe horizon that resembles the upper A horizon of Dark Gray Chernozemic soils. Commonly below the Ae horizon they have an AB or BA horizon in which the ped surfaces are grayer than the interiors of peds. The solum of Gray Luvisols is generally slightly to moderately acid but may be strongly acid. The degree of base saturation (neutral salt extraction) is generally high. The parent materials are usually base saturated and commonly calcareous, but some Gray Luvisols have developed in acid materials.

Gray Luvisols occur typically under boreal or mixed forest vegetation and in forest-grassland transition zones in a wide range of climatic areas. Their main area of occurrence is in the subhumid central to northern part of the Interior Plains, but they occur also in humid and perhumid areas of eastern Canada. In the latter climatic area, they occur mainly on medium- to fine-textured parent materials.

Gray Luvisols have eluvial and Bt horizons. Their mean annual soil temperature is usually less than 8°C. If the soil moisture regime is subhumid, any dark-colored A horizon must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

1. It is not a chernozemic A.
2. It is underlain by a thicker Ae horizon that extends to a depth greater than 15 cm below the mineral surface.
3. It shows evidence of degradation (Ahe) and is underlain by an Ae horizon at least 5 cm thick below the Ahe or Ap horizon.
The great group is divided into 14 subgroups based on the kind and sequence of horizons and evidence of gleying.</string></array>

2. They have a Bt horizon.
3. They lack a Bf horizon.
4. They lack a fragipan.
5. They may have a dark-colored, mineral-organic surface horizon (Ah or Ahe) less than 5 cm thick.
6. They may have an Ap horizon, but its dry color value must be 5 or higher.
7. Distinct mottling, that indicates gleying does not occur within 50 cm of the mineral surface. Prominent mottling does not occur at depths of 50-100 cm.

These soils have the properties specified for the Luvisolic order and the Gray Luvisol great group. They differ from Orthic Gray Luvisols by having an Ah or Ahe horizon 5 cm or more in thickness. These horizons generally have eluvial features, such as gray streaks or splotches when dry, or platy structure. In the case of disturbed soils, the dry color value of the Ap horizon is 3.5-5.0 and some of the Ae horizon remains below the Ap.

	<dict>
	<key>Description</key>
	<array><string>Soils of this great group are composed largely of relatively undecomposed fibric organic material. Fibric material is usually classified on the von Post scale of decomposition as classes 1-4. Fibrisols occur extensively in Canada, particularly in peat deposits dominated by sphagnum mosses.

Fibrisols have a dominantly fibric middle tier, or middle and surface tiers if a terric, lithic, or hydric contact occurs in the middle tier. Fibric material is the least decomposed type of organic material. It contains large amounts of well-preserved fiber that is retained on a 100-mesh sieve (0.15 mm) and can be identified as to botanical origin. A fibric horizon has 40% or more of rubbed fiber by volume and a pyrophosphate index of 5 or more (see Chapter 2, Organic horizons, Of). If the rubbed fiber volume is 75% or more, the pyrophosphate criterion does not apply. Dominantly fibric means that fibric material is the most abundant type of organic material. If both fibric and mesic layers occur in the middle tier, the tier is dominantly fibric if more than half of its thickness is composed of fibric material. If fibric, mesic, and humic layers are present in the middle tier, it is dominantly fibric if the thickness of fibric layers is greater than that of either mesic or humic layers. Subdominant in the following definitions means next in abundance to the dominant material but the layer must not be less than 12 cm in thickness if sharply contrasting (Of vs. Oh), or 25 cm in thickness if not sharply contrasting (Om vs. Of or Oh).</string></array>

<key>Folisol</key>

<key>Description</key>
	<array><string>Soils of the Folisol great group are composed of upland organic (folic) materials, generally of forest origin, that are either 40 cm or more in thickness, or are at least 10 cm thick if overlying bedrock or fragmental material. Deep Folisols (greater than 40 cm of folic material) occur frequently in cool, moist, and humid forest ecosystems, particularly on the West Coast of Canada. They also develop in northern regions where soil temperatures are low, but the soil is without permafrost. Shallow Folisols are found throughout Canada and commonly occur on upper slope shedding positions over bedrock and on, or incorporated in, fragmental or skeletal material.

Folic materials are formed under ecosystems different from those of peat materials. Folic materials are the product of upland ecosystem development, whereas peat materials are the product of wetland development.

Folisols are well to imperfectly drained, although they may become saturated after rainfall or snowmelt. They contain organic C at a level of &gt;17% (about 30% or more Organic matter) by weight in diagnostic horizons. Folic materials qualify as Folisols if they meet the following criteria:

1. Folic material is 40 cm or more in depth; or
2. Folic material is 10 cm or more in depth if directly overlying a lithic contact.or fragmental material, or if occupying voids in fragmental or skeletal material; or
3. Folic material is more than twice the thickness of a mineral soil layer if the mineral layer is less than 20 cm thick.
Folic materials containing permafrost at depths of 1 m or less are classified as Cryosolic soils.

The Folisol great group is divided into four subgroups, based on the degree of decomposition of the folic material (as distinguished by the diagnostic F and H soil horizons) or on the type of organic materials in the control section, or on both. Layers or pockets of decaying wood may be designated as an F or an H</string></array>
<key>HE.FO</key><array><string>Hemic Folisol</string><string>Common horizon sequence: L, F, H, O, R, (M1)

Soils of this subgroup are composed dominantly of the moderately decomposed F horizon in the control section and may have subdominant H and O horizons, each less than 10 cm thick. They commonly have a lithic contact or fragmental layers but meet the requirements of the Folisol great group. The F horizon consists of partly decomposed folic material generally derived from mosses, leaves, twigs, reproductive structures, and woody materials containing numerous live and dead roots.

Hemic Folisols usually occur on upper slope shedding positions and commonly consist of shallow folic material over bedrock or fragmental material, or the folic materials may occupy voids in fragmental material. There may be a thin layer of mineral soil separating the folic horizon from bedrock or from the fragmental material.

Soils of this subgroup are composed dominantly of the well-decomposed H horizon in the control section and may have subdominant F and O horizons each less than 10 cm thick. A lithic contact, fragmental, or mineral layers may be common in the control section, but the soils meet the requirements for the Folisol great group.

Humic Folisols occur most frequently in cool, moist, humid forest ecosystems. Although they occur in many landscape positions, they commonly develop on lower slopes and in valley bottoms. Rooting channels and other voids are common in these soils.</string></array>
<key>LI.FO</key><array><string>Lignic Folisol</string><string>Common horizon sequence: L, F, H, R, (M1)

Soils of this subgroup are dominated by F or H horizons, which are composed primarily of moderately to well-decomposed woody materials. These materials occupy more than 30% of the surface area of the F and H horizons. The decaying wood that makes up the F and H horizons generally consists of trees that have been blown down. The destruction of trees is either a continuing process in unevenly aged forests or occurs at periodic intervals as a result of major storms, which create evenly aged forest stands. Lignic Folisols also occur in a second-growth forest as a result of logging.</string></array>
<key>HI.FO</key><array><string>Histic Folisol</string><string>Common horizon sequence: L, F, H, O, R, (M1)

Soils of this subgroup are dominated by F or H horizons and are directly underlain by a significant (greater than 10 cm) O horizon. Generally, saturation or high water tables (resulting from drainage impediment caused by mineral horizon cementation or localized bedrock configuration) initially encouraged the production of peat. Peat development subsequently became deep enough to produce surface conditions suitable for forest encroachment and Folisol development.

They occur typically in wet sites so that they are saturated with water during some periods of the year. Characteristically they occur under heath, forest and heath, sphagnum, or western coastal forest vegetation in maritime fringe environments, on some sites at high elevations inland, and in peaty depressions. Under virgin conditions Humic Podzols usually have thick L, F, and H or O horizons underlain by a light-colored eluvial horizon (Ae), an eluvial horizon darkened by humic material, or by a podzolic B horizon, which is usually a Bh. The B horizon may include several kinds of podzolic B subhorizons: Bh, Bhf, and Bf, which may be cemented (ortstein, placic) or friable. The material below the podzolic B horizon may be cemented (duric), compact and brittle (fragipan), or friable.

Humic Podzols have a Bh horizon at least 10 cm thick that usually occurs at the top of the B horizon but may occur below other B horizons. The Bh horizon contains more than 1% organic C and less than 0.3% pyrophosphate-extractable Fe and has a ratio of organic C to pyrophosphate-extractable Fe of 20 or more.

Humic Podzols are generally strongly acid and their B horizons are usually less than 50% base saturated (neutral salt). The pH dependent CEC of the Bh horizon is usually well above 8 cmol kg-1.

Under disturbed conditions and where the Bh horizon directly underlies the organic surface layer, the Bh may be confused with an Ah horizon. The guidelines that aid in making this distinction are that more than 50% of the organic C of Bh horizons is extractable by NaOH-Na4P2O7 and more than 50% of the extractable C of Bh horizons is fulvic acid carbon. Cultivated Humic Podzols are identified by properties of the B horizon below the cultivated layer.

A placic horizon (Bhfc, Bfc, Bfgc) consists of a single thin layer that is commonly 5 mm or less in thickness, or a series of thin layers that are irregular or involute, hard, impervious, often vitreous, and dark reddish brown to black in color. These thin horizons are apparently cemented by Fe-organic complexes, hydrated Fe oxides, or a mixture of Fe and Mn oxides. The placic horizon or thin iron pan may occur in any part of the B horizon except the Bh, and commonly it extends into the BC horizon.

Placic Humic Podzols usually have L, F, and H or O horizons and an Ae horizon. They do not have an ortstein horizon but may have a duric horizon or a fragipan.

A duric horizon is a strongly cemented horizon that does not satisfy the criteria of a podzolic B horizon. It usually has an abrupt upper boundary to an overlying podzolic B horizon and a diffuse lower boundary at least 50 cm below. Cementation is usually strongest near the upper boundary, which occurs commonly at a depth of 40-80 cm from the mineral surface. Usually the color of a duric horizon differs little from that of the parent material, and the structure is usually massive or very coarse platy. Moist clods at least 3 cm thick usually cannot be broken in the hands. Air-dry clods of the material do not slake when immersed in water. Some duric horizons may meet the requirements of a Bt horizon (Btc).

A fragipan (Bx or BCx) is a subsurface horizon of high bulk density that has firm and brittle consistence when moist and hard to extremely hard consistence when dry. Usually it is of medium texture. Commonly it has bleached fracture planes separating very coarse prismatic units and the secondary structure is platy. Usually the fragipan is similar in color to the parent material, but it differs in structure and consistence and sometimes in bulk density. The upper boundary of a fragipan is usually either abrupt or clear, but the lower boundary is usually diffuse.

	<key>Description</key><array><string>These are soils that occur in the most arid segment of the climatic range of Chernozemic soils and have brownish-colored A horizons. They are associated with xerophytic and mesophytic grass and forb vegetation. In virgin Brown Chernozems the upper part of the Ah horizon is commonly as light as or lighter in color value than the lower part of the Ah or the upper B horizon.

Brown Chernozems have chernozemic Ah or Ap horizons with color values darker than 3.5 moist and 4.5-5.5 dry. The chroma of the A horizon is usually higher than 1.5.

	<key>O.BC</key><array><string>Orthic Brown Chernozem</string><string>Common horizon sequence: Ah, Bm, Cca or Ck

The Orthic Brown Chernozem subgroup may be thought of as the central concept of Brown Chernozems. It encompasses the properties specified for the Chernozemic order and the Brown Chernozem great group. Orthic Brown Chernozems are well drained and their B horizons are usually brown with prismatic macrostructure. The prismatic peds are usually coarse in coarse-textured soils. With increasing clay content, the peds become smaller and have an increasing tendency to crush to fine blocky and granular aggregates. Thin clay coatings occur occasionally to commonly on ped surfaces in the B horizon. A light-colored horizon of carbonate accumulation usually occurs below the brownish B horizon.

Orthic Brown Chernozems are identified by the following properties:

They have a Chernozemic A horizon with a color value darker than 3.5 moist and 4.5-5.5 dry.
They have a B horizon (Bm, Btj, or Bt) at least 5 cm thick that contains no alkaline earth carbonates.
They lack an Ae horizon at least 2 cm thick.
They lack a Bnjtj horizon or a similar horizon characteristic of intergrades to the Solonetzic order.
They lack evidence of gleying as indicated by faint to distinct mottling within 50 cm of the mineral surface.
Orthic Brown Chernozems and all other subgroups of Chernozemic soils may have any of the following features that are separated either at the family or series level taxonomically or as phases of any taxonomic level above the family: lithic, saline, and carbonated.</string></array>

These soils have the general properties of the Chernozemic order and the Brown Chernozem great group. They differ from Orthic Brown Chernozems by having an eluvial horizon or horizons at least 2 cm thick (Ahe, Ae, Aej) usually underlain by a weakly to moderately developed illuvial Btj or Bt horizon. Commonly, the eluvial horizon is slightly to moderately acid. Two variations of this subgroup may be recognized.

One variation has pedons in which eluviation is indicated by light-colored, relic, macroprismatic structure below the Ah or Ap. The prismatic units break into coarse to medium platy peds that commonly have vesicular or tubular voids. This structure suggests the development of an eluvial horizon from a former prismatic B. The Bt or Btj horizon underlying the eluvial horizon usually has well-developed macroprismatic structure that breaks to blocky peds of lower color value and slightly higher chroma than the eluvial horizon.

The other variation has cumulic pedons in which the periodic deposition of transported soil materials modifies the normal horizon differentiation caused by leaching. These pedons have thick horizons of partly leached, accumulated materials overlying former A or transitional AB horizons. They are usually found on lower concave slopes where sediments are deposited from upslope. Commonly, such pedons can be recognized by their thick Ahe horizons.

<key>SZ.DGC</key><array><string>Solonetzic Dark Gray Chernozem</string><string>Common horizon sequence: Ahe, Ae, Bnjtj, Cs or Ck

These soils have the general properties specified for the Chernozemic order and the Dark Gray Chernozem great group. They differ from Orthic Dark Gray Chernozems by having properties indicative of intergrading to the Solonetzic order. Specifically, they have either a Bnj, Bnjtj, or Btnj horizon, and they may have Ae, AB, and saline C horizons. The Ae horizon, if present, is not more than 5 cm thick. The B horizon usually has prismatic structure and hard consistence, and the prisms usually break to blocky secondary structural units with shiny, dark coatings. Solonetzic Dark Gray Chernozems are usually associated with saline materials. Thus, their B horizons usually have a higher proportion of exchangeable Na or Na and Mg than is characteristic of Orthic Dark Gray Chernozems.

These soils have the general properties specified for the Chernozemic order and the Dark Gray Chernozem great group. Theymay have any horizons in the upper solum common to other subgroups within the Dark Gray Chernozem great group. However, they differ from other subgroups by having properties indicative of intergrading to the Vertisolic order. Specifically, they have a slickenside horizon (Bss, Bkss or Ckss), the upper boundary of which occurs within 1 m of the mineral soil surface. As well, they may have a weak vertic horizon (Bvj or BCvj).</string></array>

				<string>These are soils that generally occur in the most arid portion of the climatic range of Vertisolic soils. They are primarily associated with a native vegetation of xerophytic and mesophytic grasses and forbs. They have both a vertic and a slickenside horizon as specified for the Vertisolic order. Except for the poorly drained members, they also have brownish-colored A horizons (dry color value of 3.5 or lighter, chroma usually greater than 1.5 dry, and organic C usually 3% or less) similar to associated Chernozemic soils. However, they differ from Chernozemic soils in that it is often difficult to separate the A horizon from the rest of the solum based on color alone, and the Ah horizon is massive and hard when dry. They also lack other horizons, in the upper solum, common to Chernozemic or other soils.

The poorly drained members occur commonly in depressional positions associated with better-drained Vertisolic soils. Besides the presence of both a slickenside and a vertic horizon, they have the general characteristics specified for the Gleysolic order. As well, under native conditions they lack a mineral-organic surface (Ah) horizon 10 cm or more in thickness. If cultivated the Ap horizon has one of the following properties:

Less than 2% organic C.
A rubbed color value greater than 3.5 (moist) or greater than 5.0 (dry).
Little contrast in color value with the underlying layer (a difference of less than 1.5 units, if the value of the underlying layer is 4 or more, or a difference of less than 1 unit, if that value is less than 4).</string>

				<string>These Vertisolic soils occur in the more moist portion of the climatic range of Vertisolic soils and are primarily associated with a native vegetation of mesophytic grasses and forbs or with mixed grass, forb, and tree cover. They have an A horizon that is darker in color than soils of the Vertisol great group. Except for the poorly drained members, the surface horizon has a dry color value of less than 3.5, chroma usually 1.5 or less dry, and organic C usually greater than 3%. The A horizon is easily distinguishable from lower horizons based on color alone. However, the boundary between the A horizon and lower horizons is usually very irregular. These soils have both a vertic and a slickenside horizon as specified for the Vertisolic order. They lack other horizons in the upper solum, common to other soils, except they may have a Chernozemic-like A horizon. The poorly drained members occur commonly in depressional positions associated with better-drained Vertisolic soils. Besides the presence of both a slickenside and a vertic horizon, they have the general characteristics specified for the Gleysolic order. As well, under native conditions they have a mineral-organic surface (Ah) horizon 10 cm or more in thickness. If cultivated, the Ap horizon has all the following properties:

At least 2% organic C.
A rubbed color value of 3.5 or less (moist) or 5.0 or less (dry).
At least 1.5 units of color value (moist) lower than that of the next underlying horizon, if the color value (moist) of that horizon is 4 or more, or 1 unit of color value lower than that of the underlying horizon, if its color value is less than 4.</string>
